Here's a simple example of a C program that demonstrates basic concepts like input, output, and a loop. This program will ask the user for a number and then print the multiplication table for that number.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number, i;

    // Asking the user for a number
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // Printing the multiplication table
    printf("Multiplication table for %d:\n", number);
    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", number, i, number * i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. Include Header Files: The `#include <stdio.h>` line includes the standard input-output library, which allows us to use `printf` and `scanf` functions.

2. Main Function: The `int main()` function is the entry point of the program.

3. Variable Declaration: We declare two integer variables, `number` to store the user's input and `i` for the loop counter.

4. User Input: The `printf` function prompts the user to enter a number. The `scanf` function reads the input and stores it in the `number` variable.

5. Loop for Multiplication Table: A `for` loop runs from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, we calculate the product of the `number` and the loop index `i`, and print it.

6. Return Statement: The `return 0;` statement indicates that the program finished successfully.

### How to Compile and Run:

1. Save the code in a file named `multiplication_table.c`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Compile the program using:
   ```
   gcc multiplication_table.c -o multiplication_table
   ```
5. Run the program with:
   ```
   ./multiplication_table
   ```
